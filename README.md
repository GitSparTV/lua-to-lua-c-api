# lua-to-lua-c-api
Lua to Lua C API transpiler built with Fengari.

Tool for making quick and draft representations of how Lua code looks like made with Lua C API.
Pretend it's WIP or proof of concept because the stack will definitely leave some values.
Moving registers is not implemented because you will have 100 lines of just popping and pushing values.
